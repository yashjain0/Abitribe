          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
          <p>The SERVICE SELECTION BOARD is the authority that assesses young candidates for becoming officers in the Indian Armed Forces using a standardized evaluation system to test their intelligence, personality and physical capabilities. From the reporting day to the conference day, generally it takes around 5-6 days to complete SSB Interviews. Cracking SSB interview and becoming officer in the Armed Forces is a dream to millions of candidates, but most people don’t understand the basic psychological analysis behind the interview process. This creates confusion among candidates. Amidst all the hype around and all the Frequently Made Mistakes, I am writing my experiences in simplified manner to make it easy to understand for all. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
I do not claim to be an expert and the contents of this blog are mere an outcome of my real-life experiences and speculations of what goes into deciding the future officer in the Indian Armed Forces. I cleared my SSB Interview at AFSB-1 Dehradun for NDA-II 2016 with a rank of 97 (All India Merit List), although failing the stringent medical criteria to join the academy. But my experiences and a lot of discussion with a lot of candidates over the years has made me write this blog and help all the defence aspirants in preparing the right way.
<br>
References - <strong> My Appointment With A Psychologist </strong> <em>by Krish Nair & Anoop T.</em> I would strongly recommend any SSB aspirant to read this book if you really want to know the insights of SSB interview.<br>
I HOPE READING THIS BLOG HELPS YOU IN DECIDING THE RIGHT PATH TO SUCCEED IN LIFE. <br>

        <div class="section-title" data-aos="fade-left">
          <h2>THE SCREENING DAY.</h2>
          <p>The DAY 1 or the Screening day is when 70-80 percent of the candidates are sent home after initial screening. This is due to limits in accommodation at the SSB centres, they have to do a quick filtering of the candidates called for SSB. The screening test includes a verbal, non-verbal intelligence test (around 50 questions each), a Picture Perception and Description Test (PPDT). PPDT consists of a blurry image projected for about 30 seconds, and then all candidates are asked to write a story in around 5 minutes. This is a simple test of perception, but the important part is the Group Discussion that follows where around 15-20 candidates are made to sit and narrate their stories and a common plot is to be framed. By the end of Day 1 they screen in the candidates based on their performances in these two tests. </p>
          <p>IMPORTANT TIP- Make sure you include good points from others' stories and try to adapt as per group. Your story written on paper may or may not be read by the assessing Officers, so keep on including good points as others speak as the main assessment is for the speaking skills and your thinking capacity.
Based on these two tests almost 5 out of 6 candidates have to leave the SSB on the first day itself and that's a huge number.<br> <strong> SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE PREPARED ENOUGH TO SCREEN IN.</strong>
<br>
ALSO, when you screen in be VERY CAREFUL while filling the PIQ Form they make you fill as this forms a basis of your assessment in the INTERVIEW ROUND. </p>

        <div class="section-title" data-aos="fade-up">
          <h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING</h2>
          <p>There are mainly three divisions of testing one has to go through once he/she is screened-in on DAY-1. Although other tests are also important, but I do believe that its the PSYCHOLOGICALTESTING that sets the base for further testing. So it is very important to know why and how Psychology is tested. It is a 3 hour long marathon writing test, that has mainly four sections for assessing you as a person. The written test extracts the information you provide as per different situations, this helps them decide how you will react to a particular situation at any point of time. Later on at the ground tasks or during your stay you are constantly judged that whatever you say about yourself, do you really follow what you wrote in your daily life.<br>
For example if you write yourself as a Team Player, do you really coordinate with the team in the group tasks?? Or if you mark yourself as a good listener, do you show this trait in the Group Discussions that follow.
<br>
DO REMEMBER-
<strong> "SSB IS A TEST OF PERSONALITY AND A PERSONALITY IS VOLATILE AND INFINITE. IT KEEPS ON CHANGING BY DIFFERENT FACTORS IN YOUR LIFE." </strong> <br>
'Every stimulus, creates a response in every living organism' and psychological assessment is a process to extract out your personality traits by your immediate responses to different arenas of life.<br>
<em>PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING conists of the following tests: </em></p>
        </div>

        <div >
          <div class="container" data-aos="fade-down">
          <ul style="list-style-type:square">
            <li>
<h3 class="psychology-title">WAT – Word Association Test </h3> <br>
Around 50-60 words are projected back to back for about 10 seconds, and you have to form a sentence using those words. Clearly people often mistake this as a sentence framing test, or how good your vocabulary is. But WAT is a test of your subconscious imagination and how you associate a particular word in your life.  Each sentence tells something about you traits as a person to the assessor. Make sure you don’t write the obvious, avoid explaining the word itself. Like if the word is Honesty, you should not write ‘Honesty is the best policy’ rather focus on how you relate honesty to your own life.</li>
<li>

<h3 class="psychology-title">TAT – Thematic Aptitude Test </h3><br>
TAT is a test of ‘Perception’ it aims to judge a person’s quality by his/her imagination of thoughts by the immediate ‘response’ he/she shows to a particular picture. Around 10 different pictures are projected back to back, you have to observe a picture and write a story related to it. You firstly have to identify the protagonist or the hero of the story and then analyse the situation. The basic idea is how good you can link a picture to a problem and how wide your imagination can take you to solve it. You don’t have to make your hero as a superhero, because it looks childish, so the crisis and the response of your story must be clear and logical. </li>
<li>
<h3 class="psychology-title">SRT- Situation Reaction Test</h3><br>
SRT is a test of ‘Reaction’, every problem in life has a solution although approaches can be different depending on the person. SRT puts you into problem and see how you react to the situation. The assessor wants a practical answer on how you react to a particular situation, do you like to face a situation or do you withdraw from it. For example, consider you have an important interview, and on your way, an old lady asks you to help her reach home. How will you react to it?? Your answer is your perception, and there’s not always right or wrong about it. Some situations demand response, others demand withdrawal while some might demand compromise, so choose wisely.</li>
<li>

<h3 class="psychology-title">
  SD- SELF DESCRIPTION</h3><br>
SD is the last section of the Psychological Testing and you’ll be tired when it arrives after continuously writing for around 2.5 hours. This is a basic test of ‘Self-assessment’. The test tries to extract information of how you rate yourself as a person, what you think is your parents’/friends’ opinion about you, what are your responsibilities towards your family or society, what all changes in yourself you want to see. So these are some basic questions on how well you know about yourself.

          <h2>GROUP TESTING: (GTO)</h2>
          <p>The GTO testing extracts the dynamism of your personality when applied to the context of a group. Here, people often mistaken that a group is judged as a whole, but the assessment is purely individual and every task you perform has a positive or negative impact on your score. These tasks are designed to test how a person will function when put in a group, will he only take orders or will he just give orders or will he just speculate others. Every individual performs differently in these tasks and you can’t train yourself to act in a fixed manner. Your efforts will vary based on different situations.
            <br>
Group testing is divided into three major subparts:
</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row group-container" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">

        <ol>
          <li> <strong> 	PGT (Progressive Group Tasks)</strong> <br>
            <p>••	The group is given around 30 minutes and a series of obstacles, required materials and other instructions and the task is to complete all the obstacles. Generally you have to take some material from one boundary to other boundary. <br>
•	The approach here is to show the team-game and not to win individual battles. Remember a team’s strength is the strength of its weakest link, so assess all your moves keeping the group in mind. Do pay close attention to what the GTO tells about the task and then proceed.
</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>	GPE(Group Planning Exercise)</strong><br>
            <p> •	GPE is one of the most interesting tasks of the SSB, it is where all your planning and imagination with cumulative assessment of risks involved come into play. You are made to sit around a sand model and there is a problem in the scenario. <br>
•	Your task is to solve the problem in the most practical manner analysing all the risks involved. This is a Group Discussion round, so every individual has to first pen down the plan on a paper and then discuss it with the group. The final output of the executable plan is what the whole group agrees with.
</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong> 	CT(Command  Task)</strong><br>
            <p> •	The command task is a confirmatory test of your ‘leadership’, since all the testing till now has been along with the group; here each individual is assessed by his ability to command a team. You are given a set of obstacles and the required materials; your task is to call some of your teammates for help. <br>
•	In this task have to make a plan to clear all the obstacles and guide your teammates along. The assessor tests your ability to explain your plan and innovate if one plan fails. Also this is a test of how well you assess your teammates.

          <h2>PERSONAL INTERVIEW ROUND</h2>
          <p>The personal interview in SSB is different from what all the technical interviews you might face applying for a job, it is a simple one on one conversation that actually sets the link between what other tasks have assessed. The interviewing officer sets assumptions and inferences by your answers and decides on how suitable are you to become that ‘FUTURE LEADER’ in the armed forces. <br><br>
<ul>
<li> This is a test of knowledge and a test of how good you are at communicating your ideas. Since you are applying for an esteemed position in the armed forces you are required to have some knowledge about its organisation. For example- the rank structure is one of the most common questions. You have to show how excited you are to join the services through some questions. There might be some rapid fire questioning where 5 to 10 questions may be asked at one go and you are required to answer them in the same order.<br> <br></li>
<li>On the other half most of the questions are from your personal life, and for that you have to know a lot about yourself. There are questions on your strengths, your weaknesses, your pastimes, your hobbies, your achievements etc. You must be aware of how to answer these, try not to cover your actual personality as at some point or the other your actual self is revealed.<br> <br></li>
<em>IMPORTANT TIP-</em> Try not to worry much about the personal interview and be relaxed about it. Most of the things will be related to your lifestyle try to be honest about it.<br> <br>

Be the person you are, if you act fake at one point or the other it will come out. Stay calm and act normally. 2. Never act opposite to what you decide as a team during Group Tasks, you are not fighting against your own group, SSB is a test of you as a person. 3. Never contradict yourself during SSB interviews, this follows point 1 if you are honest then at no point you will contradict your own statements. 4. The premises of SSB are closely watched and any violent act against other candidate or staff will be a point noted against you and in severe cases you might be asked to leave. 5. All the forms especially the forms that you get after the Screening play an important role in your assessment. Be attentive whilst filling any information you provide about yourself.
